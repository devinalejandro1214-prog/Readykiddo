# ReadyKiddo Agent Collaboration Log

This file is the shared handoff space for Codex and Claude Code.

## Agreed Roles

Codex role:
- Act as Devin's development support and project organizer.
- Organize folders, assets, characters, images, and project files.
- Create, edit, clean up, and prepare image assets.
- Manage GitHub commits, pushes, repo structure, and Netlify deploy verification.
- Handle Canva/image/export style tasks when useful.
- Review code-adjacent changes for integration issues, paths, deployment, and file structure.

Claude Code role:
- Write and modify the website code.
- Build the site UI, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, onboarding flow, pages, and interactive behavior.
- Use Codex's organized assets and file paths when implementing site features.
- Log code changes and any files touched after each prompt.

Collaboration rule:
- Codex should avoid taking over full site-code implementation when the user is specifically asking Claude to code the site, unless Devin directly asks Codex to fix or sync something.
- Claude should avoid reorganizing assets, GitHub/Netlify, folder structure, or image-processing work unless Devin directly asks Claude to do it.
- Both agents should read this file before working and append a new entry after finishing a prompt.

How to use it:
- Add a new entry after each user prompt you act on.
- Keep entries newest-at-bottom so the timeline stays readable.
- Include what changed, where it changed, whether it was pushed/deployed, and any follow-up needed.
- Do not delete another agent's notes unless Devin explicitly asks.

Entry template:

```md

Suggested prompt for Claude Code:

```text
Before working, read AGENT_COLLAB_LOG.md in the ReadyKiddo2.0 folder. Your role is to write and modify the website code. Codex's role is project organization, GitHub/Netlify, folders, images, and assets. After you finish each prompt, append your actions, files touched, and any next steps to AGENT_COLLAB_LOG.md.
```
